  <div class="description">
    <p>This CBC SHAPE Inventory is a tool for Calvarians to better understand how God has "SHAPE"-ed each of us to serve Him in His kingdom. It is not definitive, but it should hopefully help you explore more purposefully in the areas that you are gifted for.</p>
    <p>S.H.A.P.E. are five aspects we take into consideration on what God has gifted you with - Spiritual Gifts, Heart (Passion), Abilities, Personality, and Experience.</p>
    <p>The entire inventory will take about 2 hours to complete - you can complete all the aspects in one sitting, or break it up to each of the aspects. Either way, do approach it prayerfully and as much as possible, in an unrushed manner. :)</p>
    <p>There will be a consultation session with a pastoral or ministry staff after completion, to process through the responses, recommend areas to serve in, and pray and journey with you.</p>
    <p>This particular inventory is adapted from the Purpose Driven church resources by Saddleback Church, and is only meant for internal use in Calvary Baptist Church.</p>
    <p>For any further questions regarding the SHAPE inventory, please contact Angel at angellim@calvary.org.sg.</p>
